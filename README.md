# LiteLookup ðŸ”Ž

LiteLookup is a command-line tool developed in Python that fetches beginner-level information about any concept directly from the command line. This tool is designed for users who want quick, concise, and accessible explanations without leaving their terminal.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Uses `argparse` to handle user inputs.
- **Error Handling:** Validates user input to ensure meaningful queries. Catches special characters and raises appropriate errors.
- **API Integration:** Utilizes the Groq LLM API to generate concise explanations of the concepts provided.
- **Caching:** Implements Redis for persistent caching of API responses, reducing unnecessary API calls and improving response times.
- **Interactive Shell Session:** Launches an intractive shell for faster, continuous lookups after the initial connection establishment. This mode is ideal for making multiple queries in a single session without the overhead of reconnecting for each request.
- **Verbose Mode:** Use the `-v` flag for more detailed explanations, including examples or code snippets when applicable.
- **HTTP/2 Support:** Uses `httpx` with connection pooling and HTTP/2 for efficient API communication.
- **Expandable:** Designed to be easily extended with new features and enhancements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Redis server installed and running
- Groq LLM API access â€” You will need to store a valid Groq API Key as a secret. You can generate one for free [here](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### Setup

1. **Install LiteLookup via pip or pipx:**

   `pip install litelookup` or `pipx install litelookup`

   Check if LiteLookup is correctly installed with
   `lookup --version`

2. **Configure the environment variables:**

    Enter the API Key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) in the prompt from the first usage:

    `>>Enter API KEY here: your-api_key here` 
    
    Replace "your_api_key_here" with the API key to begin interacting with the tool.


3. Ensure Redis is running:

    `redis-cli ping`

    You should get `PONG` which indicates redis is up and running.
 
## Usage

### Basic Usage
To fetch information about a concept, use the following command:

`lookup "concept"`

For example, `lookup "git rebase"`

### Verbose Mode
For a more detailed response, including examples or code snippets:

`lookup "git rebase" -v'

### Programming Mode

lookup "programming concept" -p

For example, `lookup "print() in python" -p`

### Interactive Shell Mode
Enter the interactive mode for continuous lookups without reconnecting:

- `lookup -i`

If you wish to generate verbose responses while in the interactive mode, use

- `lookup -i -v` or `lookup -iv`
The responses you get with this will be slightly detailed without overwhelming you. 

- `lookup -i -p` or `lookup -ip
The responses you get with this will be more finetuned for programming. 

To exit the interactive mode, type:

- `quit` or `q`
